Write a control file parser.

Change parse.c to understand the following directives:
	.ro
	.global
	.export
	.import

Extend sam_es to keep a list of ha's that are automatically memory managed.

.ro calls sam_es_ro_alloc():
	* appends to list of automatic ha's
	* mallocs the appropriate amount
	* sets the value
	* adds symbol to symbol table

.global calls sam_es_global_alloc():
	* appends to list of automatic ha's
	* mallocs the appropriate amount
	* adds symbol to symbol table

.export calls sam_es_export():
	* appends symbol to list of things we want to export after the
	  program has run

.import calls sam_es_import():
