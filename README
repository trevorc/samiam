Compilation instructions
=========== ============

Ensure your system has the dependencies for building.

Samiam and libsam:
Run the command `scons' from the root samiam directory (the one with
SConstruct in it.)

Documentation:
Issue the command `make' from the doc directory.

Test suite:
Issue the command `make check' from the tests directory.

Dependencies
============

To compile samiam, you will need:

    * (currently) gcc. If you remove the gcc extensions (the
      __attribute__()s), you should be left with clean c99.
      I've tested it with gcc 4.1.2 and 3.4.4.
    * scons. I've tested with scons 0.96.93.D001 and 0.96.92.D002.
    * Python (for scons). I've tested with Python 2.4.2, 2.4.4, and 2.5.

To compile the documentation, you will need:

    * xsltproc.
    * docbook-xsl.

To run the test suites, you will need:

    * gcc.
    * Python.
    * GNU make. I've tested 3.8.1. Soon this dependency will disappear.
    * Perl. I've tested 5.8.8. Soon this dependency will disappear.

Samiam itself has no dependencies (except for libsam, libc, libm and
optionally libdl).

In addition, I've made a few shell scripts that make it easy to run and test
samiam.
