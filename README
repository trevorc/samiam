for the impatient:

    $ make

for the non-linux and non-gcc users:

the source code to libsam, samiam and jbc_test is c89-clean. however,
the project is optimized for unix, in particular i686-pc-linux-gnu.
you will find the best results with GNU make (make on linux, gmake on
BSD).

if you are not using gcc, you *will* have to change rul.mk. your compiler
almost certainly does not understand gcc flags.

if you are not on a modern unix, look at libsam/config.h. #undef HAVE_MMAN_H
and HAVE_UNISTD_H to make libsam compile. you may also have to undef
HAVE_LOCALE_H.

if you're getting the error "error while loading shared libraries:
libsam.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" or
similar, try installing the library to a system-wide location or adding
the directory that the library is in to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

if all else fails, try:

    $ cc -o samiam/samiam -lm -Linclude samiam/samiam.c libsam/sam_*.c
